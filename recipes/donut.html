        <h2 class="subtitle">Steps to make donut:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough. The dough comes together with a mixer. You can also 
            make the dough by hand, but it requires a bit of arm muscle. After the dough 
            comes together in the mixing bowl, knead it for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise. In a relatively warm environment, the dough rises in 
            about 90 minutes. Then punch down the dough to release the air.</li>
            <li>Roll & cut into doughnuts. Roll the dough out to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut 
            the doughnuts using a 3-3.5-inch doughnut cutter. Line 1 or 2 baking sheets 
            with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Place doughnuts (and doughnut 
            holes!) onto the lined baking sheet(s), then lightly cover and allow to rest 
            for 30 minutes as you heat the oil.</li>
            <li>Prepare the oil. Using a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven and an oil 
            thermometer, heat vegetable oil to 375°F (191°C).</li>
            <li>Fry the doughnuts. Working with 2-3 doughnuts at a time, cook for 1 
            minute on each side. Carefully remove from the oil and place onto prepared 
            rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. (See my recipe note about making the 
            doughnut holes.)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Making the glaze for the donut:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a simple 3-ingredient glaze: just milk or cream, confectioners' 
            sugar, and vanilla extract. </li>
            <li>Whisk the 3 ingredients together. Dunk each side of the warm doughnuts
            into the glaze. The glaze will set in about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
